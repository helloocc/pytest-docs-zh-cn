Sponsor
=======

pytest is maintained by a team of volunteers from all around the world in their free time. While
we work on pytest because we love the project and use it daily at our daily jobs, monetary
compensation when possible is welcome to justify time away from friends, family and personal time.

Money is also used to fund local sprints, merchandising (stickers to distribute in conferences for example)
and every few years a large sprint involving all members.

If you or your company benefit from pytest and would like to contribute to the project financially,
we are members of two online donation platforms to better suit your needs.

Tidelift
--------

`Tidelift`_ aims to make Open Source sustainable by offering subscriptions to companies which rely
on Open Source packages. This subscription allows it to pay maintainers of those Open Source
packages to aid sustainability of the work.

You can help pytest and the ecosystem by obtaining a `Tidelift subscription`_.

OpenCollective
--------------

`Open Collective`_ is an online funding platform for open and transparent communities.
It provide tools to raise money and share your finances in full transparency.

It is the platform of choice for individuals and companies that want to make one-time or
monthly donations directly to the project.
